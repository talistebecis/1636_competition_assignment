# Assignment: Machine Learning Competition

* There are two data sets training data.csv and holdout_data.csv in the input_data directory of this repo
* Set up a model predicting the variable "income" in the data set training_data.csv
  + Use this model to predict the missing income variable in the holdout_data.csv dataset
  + All data wrangling, feature engineering and modeling steps should be done in this repo. We want to see
  your work. Document what you are doing in a markdown file!
* There are NA values in the data.
* Data has been altered - do not try to find it online!
* Give us back a file called predictions.csv containing your predictions.
  + The file should be located in the output_data directory of the repo
  + The file has to be of the same length and ordering as the holdout_data.csv file!
  + The predicted column has to be named income_group_name! This means if your group name is group1 the column should be named income_group1!

Points will be given according to the formula:


$$
\begin{cases} 
      20 & RMSE < 900 \\
      \frac{1500-RMSE}{600} \cdot 20 & 900\leq RMSE\leq 1500 \\
      0 & 1500 < RMSE 
\end{cases}
$$


Good Luck!
